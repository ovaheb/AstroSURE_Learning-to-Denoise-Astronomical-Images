# AstroSURE: Learning to Denoise Astronomical Images

AstroSURE is a denoising framework designed to train deep learning models to remove noise from astronomical images without requiring access to ground truth data. The models included in this repository were trained on simulated images generated by Galsim, as well as raw data from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The approach combines Noise2Noise training with SURE (Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator) training loss.

## Features

- **Noise2Noise Training**: Trains models using pairs of noisy images without needing clean, ground truth images.
- **SURE Training Loss**: Utilizes Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimator for effective denoising without ground truth.
- **Multiple Datasets**: Includes models trained on simulated Galsim images and raw data from Hubble and Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes.
